# Get-ChildItem *.txt -Recurse: This gets all .txt files in the current directory and all subdirectories.
# Select-String SearchPattern: This searches within the files for lines that match the pattern "SearchPattern".
Get-ChildItem *.txt -Recurse | Select-String SearchPattern

# Search Case Insensitive: By default, Select-String is case-sensitive. If you want to perform a case-insensitive search, you can use the -CaseSensitive switch:
Get-ChildItem *.txt -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern SearchPattern -CaseSensitive

# Include Line Numbers: If you want to include line numbers in the output, use the -Context parameter:
Get-ChildItem *.txt -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern SearchPattern -Context 0

# Quiet Mode: If you only want to know whether or not a match exists, you can use the -Quiet switch:
Get-ChildItem *.txt -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern SearchPattern -Quiet

# Specify Search Pattern as a Regular Expression: You can use regular expressions as your search pattern:
Get-ChildItem *.txt -Recurse | Select-String -Pattern '^\d+'

# This would search for lines beginning with one or more digits.
# Remember to replace SearchPattern with the actual text or pattern you want to find.
# Please note, these commands can be computationally intensive if you have a large number of files or if the files are very large. Use them judiciously.
